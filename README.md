# Apex Arena 

**Apex Arena** is a project I built to practice C++. It's a turn-based battle game where you manage elemental creatures and fight against a computer opponent.

## Why I built this
I am a first-year student, and I wanted to learn more about C++ so, I explored OOP concepts and implemented them in this mini game. I built this game to really understand:
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** How classes like `FireApex` inherit from `BaseApex`.
* **File Handling:** I struggled with saving data at first, but I built a system to load/save the game state to `ApexData.txt`.
* **Game Logic:** Writing the basic conditions to check for type advantages (Water vs Fire) was a fun challenge.

##  Features
* **6 Element Types:** Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Flying, Ground.
* **Save System:** Your roster saves automatically so you don't lose progress.
* **Smart AI:** The computer tries to pick counters against you.

##  How to Play
1.  **Compile:** `g++ apexarena.c++ -o apexarena`
2.  **Run:** `.\apexarena`
3.  **Register:** Add your own custom predators to the game file.

## Short note
I plan to learn more topics and implement them on these types of small projects to solidify my knowledge
